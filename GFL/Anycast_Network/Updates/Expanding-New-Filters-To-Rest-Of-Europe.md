# Expanding New Filters To Rest Of Europe This Weekend
**Created on July 17th, 2020**

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to give everyone a heads up I will be expanding the new filters mentioned [here](https://gflclan.com/forums/topic/57525-preparation-and-plan-for-new-filter-rules-on-anycast-network/) to the rest of our POPs in Europe this weekend. I've already expanded the new filters to our Amsterdam POP. I forgot to announce this here earlier this week. There were some issues with some of our game servers when expanding the new filters to this POP because some services weren't on the whitelist (e.g. the CS:GO KZ server broke along with one other small service on another server), but this was corrected later on.

There is a chance this will break some services on our game servers. However, [Dreae](https://github.com/dreae), Xy, and I all have access to whitelist specific outbound services. Xy is also working to give others more restricted access to do this as well. If something breaks, we will correct it ASAP and if it ends up taking too long, we'll add the older filters back and come up with a game plan later.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know!

Thank you.
